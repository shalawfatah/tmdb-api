# MOVIE DB API
- This project is an exploration to The Movie DB API.
- I wanted to show how to handle an external REST API with nested layers.
- The tech stack used here is React (NextJS), and Tailwind. 
- The API includes all kinds of reading and associative reading of API endpoints, like related movies, most recent movies, top-rated movies, and currently popular movies.
- It also has a search functionality which uses the external API.
