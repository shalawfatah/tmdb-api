# MOVIE DB API
- This project is an exploration to The Movie DB API.
- I wanted to show how to handle an external REST API with nested layers.
- The tech stack used here is React (NextJS), and Tailwind. 
- The API includes all kinds of reading and associative reading of API endpoints, but also writing to the external API through Ratings.
